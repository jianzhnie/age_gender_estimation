**[IJCAI18] SSR-Net: A Compact Soft Stagewise Regression Network for Age Estimation**
+ A real-time age estimation model with 170KB.
+ Gender regression is included
+ Megaage-Asian age regression is included

This is a Pytorch version implementation of SSR-Net for age and gender Estimation,Keras version in here https://github.com/shamangary/SSR-Net ,but we get better accuracy.

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel CNN model called Soft Stagewise Regression Network (SSR-Net) for age estimation from a single image with a compact model size. Inspired by DEX, we address age estimation by performing multi-class classification and then turning classification results into regression by calculating the expected values. SSR-Net takes a coarse-to-fine strategy and performs multi-class classification with multiple stages. Each stage is only responsible for refining the decision of the previous stage. Thus, each stage performs a task with few classes and requires few neurons, greatly reducing the model size. For addressing the quantization issue introduced by grouping ages into classes, SSR-Net assigns a dynamic range to each age class by allowing it to be shifted and scaled according to the input face image. Both the multi-stage strategy and the dynamic range are incorporated into the formulation of soft stagewise regression. A novel network architecture is proposed for carrying out soft stagewise regression. The resultant SSR-Net model is very compact and takes only **0.32 MB**. Despite of its compact size, SSR-Netâ€™s performance approaches those of the state-of-the-art methods whose model sizes are more than 1500x larger.

## Codes

There are three different section of this project.
1. Data pre-processing
2. Training
3. Model modification and Test

We will go through the details in the following sections.

### 1. Data pre-processing
+ Download IMDB-WIKI dataset (face only) from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/.
+ Download Megaage dataset from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/MegaAge/
+ Unzip them under '~/data' or others path
+ Run the following codes for dataset pre-processing.


### 2. Training
For Age Train,first train on imdb ,then fine tune on wiki and megaage-asia
```
cd ./src
./train_ssr_adam.sh
```
For gender Train,train on imdb directly
```
cd ./src
./train_ssr_adam_gender.sh
```
### 3. Model modification and Test
Some inference frameworks like ncnn do not support arange ops,but we need stage_num parameter,so we use them as input. if you do not want deploy,you don't need do this.
model modification please reference ./src/deploy/model_slim_gender.py and ./src/deploy/model_slim_age.py.I have provided pre-trained model in models directory,you can use it directly.

Test from web camera:
```
cd ./src/deploy/
python ./test.py
```
